## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage

> **You do NOT need to have Laravel installed globally.**  
> All dependencies are managed via Composer.

### 1. Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer (https://getcomposer.org/)
- MySQL (for development)
- SQLite (for testing, in-memory)
- Git (recommended)
- XAMPP or similar stack for Windows users
- Swagger (recommended)

### 2. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/guillemgaona/Sprint5_LaravelAPIREST2.git
cd GymTracker2
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```sh
composer install
```

If you get an error about the `ext-sodium` or `ext-gd` extension, enable them in your `php.ini`:
- Open your `php.ini` (e.g. `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`)
- Find `;extension=sodium` and/or `;extension=gd` and remove the `;`
- Save and restart Apache

### 4. Environment setup

Copy the example environment file and generate the app key:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Database setup

By default, the application uses MySQL for development.
Make sure your .env file has the correct MySQL settings, for example:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=gymtracker
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

Create the gymtracker database in your MySQL server before running migrations.

You can use phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or the command line:

Note:
The automated tests use an in-memory SQLite database, so you do not need to configure SQLite for development.

> The automated tests use an in-memory SQLite database, so you do **not** need to configure SQLite for development.

### 6. Run migrations and seeders

This command will create all tables and populate them with sample data (roles, users, exercises, etc.).
```sh
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### 7. Install Passport

```sh
php artisan passport:install
```
This command will create the access clients and encryption keys necessary for OAuth2 authentication.

If they are already create a personal acces Oauth client: 

```sh
php artisan passport:client --personal
```

## üß™ Running Feature Tests

**This is the main way to verify the API.**

```sh
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature
```

Or simply:

```sh
php artisan test
```

All tests in [`tests/Feature`](tests/Feature) will be executed.

## üìñ API Documentation (Swagger)

This project uses l5-swagger to generate interactive API documentation from OpenAPI annotations in the code.

1. Generate the Documentation
The documentation is not generated automatically. Any time you add or change the API annotations in the source code, you must run this command to update the documentation file:

```sh
php artisan l5-swagger:generate
```
2. View the Documentation
Once generated, you can view the interactive documentation by running the local server:

```sh
php artisan serve
```

And then navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Duplicate Passport Migration Files

If you see errors like table 'oauth_auth_codes' already exists during migrations, you may have duplicate Passport migration files.  
**Solution:**  
- Check your database/migrations folder.
- Keep only one migration file for each Passport table (oauth_auth_codes, oauth_access_tokens, etc.).
- Delete any duplicates (files with similar names but different timestamps).

### Other Common Issues

- **Tests fail due to database:** Make sure your `phpunit.xml` contains:
  ```xml
  <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
  <env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
  ```
- **Cache issues:** Run `php artisan config:clear` and `php artisan cache:clear`.
